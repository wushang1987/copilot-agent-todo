# TODO App

This project was fully generated by the copilot agent.

The prompt is:

```
Help me build a project named "TODO".

For the back-end technology stack, use Node.js with Express.
Use pnpm as the package manager.
Connect to my MongoDB instance at the address: localhost:27017.

For the front-end technology stack, use React with Material-UI.
There should be complete test code.

The "TODO" application needs to implement common functions such as adding tasks, deleting tasks, and searching for tasks.

Please continue working on this until the task is completed.
